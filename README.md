## Introduction

As the last week of our internship has come, we were given a final project. The project consists of a portofolio project that is bassically a online CV platform.
The data from our CVs will be stored on a server and they will be returned to the web client side.



The required mentions are:
- [x] Personal information are stored in our personal back-end.
