# website_portofolio

## Introduction

As the last week of our internship has come, we were given a final project. The project consists of a portofolio project that is bassically a online CV platform.
The data from our CVs will be stored on a server and they will be returned to the web client side.



The required mentions are:
[ x ] - Personal information are stored in our personal back-end.
[ x ] - The application will work the same for all the different users.
[ x ] - Every task on our application will be shown as a pull request. For each pull request the other team members will do the code review and will test the functionality.
[ x ] - Name tasks and branches properly.
[ x ] - Use Trello to organize tasks.
